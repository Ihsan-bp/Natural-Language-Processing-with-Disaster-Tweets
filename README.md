# Disaster Tweet classification
In this project, I aimed to classify Twitter tweets related to disasters from those that are not using Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The rise of social media has made it possible for people to share their experiences and
opinions about disaster events as they occur. However, sorting through the vast amount of information on social media platforms 
to identify relevant tweets related to disaster events can be a challenging task. To address this challenge, we used NLP
techniques to build a classifier that can automatically identify tweets related to disasters.
